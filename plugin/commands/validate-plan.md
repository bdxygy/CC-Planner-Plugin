# /validate-plan

Validate a project plan for quality and completeness. Checks structure validation, cross-section consistency, testing completeness, and technical feasibility.

## When to Use

Use this command when:
- Verifying a plan before implementation
- After revising a plan with /revise-planning
- Ensuring plan follows best practices
- Checking that testing coverage is complete

## Validation Workflow

### 1. Locate and Load Plan

First, identify the plan to validate:

**Ask the user:**
- Which feature-topic plan to validate?
- Or scan for all available plans: `Glob ".pland/**/project-context.mdx"`

**Read all plan files:**
```bash
Read .pland/[feature-topic]/project-context.mdx
Read .pland/[feature-topic]/features.mdx
Read .pland/[feature-topic]/frontend-architecture.mdx
Read .pland/[feature-topic]/backend-architecture.mdx
Read .pland/[feature-topic]/frontend-testing-scenarios.mdx
Read .pland/[feature-topic]/backend-testing-cases.mdx

# Optional: Read task list files if they exist
Read .pland/[feature-topic]/frontend-tasks.yaml
Read .pland/[feature-topic]/frontend-tasks.mdx
Read .pland/[feature-topic]/backend-tasks.yaml
Read .pland/[feature-topic]/backend-tasks.mdx
```

### 2. Structure Validation

Check that all required files exist and have proper structure:

**Required files check:**
- [ ] `project-context.mdx` exists
- [ ] `features.mdx` exists
- [ ] `frontend-architecture.mdx` exists
- [ ] `backend-architecture.mdx` exists
- [ ] `frontend-testing-scenarios.mdx` exists
- [ ] `backend-testing-cases.mdx` exists

**Optional task list files (from /task-fe, /task-be):**
- [ ] `frontend-tasks.yaml` exists (optional, generated by /task-fe)
- [ ] `frontend-tasks.mdx` exists (optional, generated by /task-fe)
- [ ] `backend-tasks.yaml` exists (optional, generated by /task-be)
- [ ] `backend-tasks.mdx` exists (optional, generated by /task-be)

**Content structure check:**
- [ ] project-context.mdx has: overview, tech stack, constraints
- [ ] features.mdx has: feature list with purpose and responsibilities
- [ ] frontend-architecture.mdx has: components, state, APIs, error handling
- [ ] backend-architecture.mdx has: modules, endpoints, contracts, validation
- [ ] frontend-testing-scenarios.mdx has: scenarios for each feature
- [ ] backend-testing-cases.mdx has: test cases for each feature

**Task list content structure (if present):**
- [ ] frontend-tasks.yaml has: tasks with id, title, priority, dependencies
- [ ] frontend-tasks.yaml has: dependencyChain, blockedBy, blockedByTransitive, blocks fields
- [ ] frontend-tasks.yaml has: dependencySummary with foundation and blocked categories
- [ ] backend-tasks.yaml has: tasks with id, title, priority, dependencies
- [ ] backend-tasks.yaml has: dependencyChain, blockedBy, blockedByTransitive, blocks fields
- [ ] backend-tasks.yaml has: dependencySummary with foundation and blocked categories

**File format check:**
- [ ] Files are valid markdown (.mdx format)
- [ ] No empty files
- [ ] Files have clear section headings
- [ ] Code blocks are properly formatted

### 3. Cross-Section Consistency

Verify that all sections align with each other:

**Feature vs. Testing alignment:**
- [ ] Every feature in features.mdx has frontend testing scenarios
- [ ] Every feature in features.mdx has backend testing cases
- [ ] Testing scenarios match feature responsibilities

**Feature vs. Architecture alignment:**
- [ ] Feature frontend responsibilities match frontend architecture patterns
- [ ] Feature backend responsibilities match backend architecture structure
- [ ] New features can be implemented with defined architecture

**Frontend vs. Backend alignment:**
- [ ] Frontend API needs match backend endpoint definitions
- [ ] Data contracts are consistent between frontend and backend
- [ ] Authentication/authorization approach is consistent

**Tech stack consistency:**
- [ ] project-context.mdx tech stack matches architecture patterns
- [ ] All technology choices are compatible
- [ ] No conflicting framework/library versions mentioned

### 4. Testing Completeness

Verify that testing coverage is comprehensive:

**Frontend testing scenarios:**
- [ ] Each feature has happy path scenarios
- [ ] Each feature has edge case scenarios
- [ ] Each feature has failure state scenarios
- [ ] Scenarios are user-centric (describe user actions)
- [ ] Scenarios are specific and testable

**Backend testing cases:**
- [ ] Each feature has business rule tests
- [ ] Each feature has boundary condition tests
- [ ] Each feature has failure mode tests
- [ ] Test cases are logic-driven (not HTTP-dependent)
- [ ] Test cases are specific and verifiable

**Testing isolation check:**
- [ ] Backend tests don't require HTTP
- [ ] Backend tests don't require database
- [ ] Tests describe mocked/stubbed dependencies
- [ ] Tests are truly unit tests (not integration)

### 5. Task List Validation (if task lists exist)

Verify that task lists are complete and consistent:

**Task completeness:**
- [ ] All features from features.mdx have corresponding frontend tasks
- [ ] All features from features.mdx have corresponding backend tasks
- [ ] Each task has unique ID (fe-XXX or be-XXX format)
- [ ] Each task has valid priority (High, Medium, Low)
- [ ] Each task has description and status

**Dependency validation:**
- [ ] All task IDs in `blockedBy` reference existing tasks
- [ ] No circular dependencies detected
- [ ] `dependencyChain` correctly lists direct dependencies
- [ ] `blockedByTransitive` correctly lists all transitive dependencies
- [ ] `blocks` field correctly lists dependent tasks

**Dependency summary validation:**
- [ ] Foundation tasks have empty `blockedBy` arrays
- [ ] `dependencySummary.foundation` lists all tasks with no dependencies
- [ ] `dependencySummary.blocked` lists all tasks with dependencies
- [ ] Dependency chains are complete and traceable

**Task-plan alignment:**
- [ ] Frontend tasks align with frontend-architecture.mdx components
- [ ] Backend tasks align with backend-architecture.mdx modules
- [ ] Task dependencies reflect feature dependencies from features.mdx

### 6. Technical Feasibility

Verify that the plan is technically sound:

**Architecture feasibility:**
- [ ] Frontend architecture is implementable
- [ ] Backend architecture is implementable
- [ ] Chosen technologies are compatible
- [ ] Patterns are appropriate for the problem domain

**Brownfield specific checks (if existing project):**
- [ ] New features integrate with existing architecture
- [ ] Identified technical debt is acknowledged
- [ ] Migration paths are viable
- [ ] No breaking changes without migration plan

**Completeness check:**
- [ ] All major components are accounted for
- [ ] No "TBD" or "TODO" placeholders in critical sections
- [ ] Error handling is specified
- [ ] Authentication/authorization is addressed (if applicable)

### 7. Generate Validation Report

After all checks, generate a structured report:

**Report structure:**
```markdown

## Interactive Usage

**When validating a specific plan:**
```bash
/validate-plan user-authentication
```

**When asked to validate:**
1. Ask which plan if not specified
2. Read all plan files
3. Run all validation checks
4. Generate and present report
5. Offer to fix any issues found

**After validation:**
- If PASS: Congratulate user, plan is ready for execution
- If FAIL: List critical issues, offer to help fix
- If WARNING: List warnings, ask if user wants to address them

## Example Output

```
# Plan Validation Report: user-authentication

## Summary
PASS WITH WARNINGS

## Structure Validation
✅ PASS - All required files exist
✅ PASS - Content structure is complete
✅ INFO - Task lists found (frontend-tasks.yaml, backend-tasks.yaml)

## Cross-Section Consistency
✅ PASS - Features align with testing
⚠️ WARNING - 'reset-password' feature frontend scenarios don't mention API error handling

## Testing Completeness
✅ PASS - Frontend scenarios cover happy paths, edges, failures
⚠️ WARNING - 'reset-password' backend test cases missing password complexity validation test

## Task List Validation
✅ PASS - All features have corresponding frontend and backend tasks
✅ PASS - No circular dependencies detected
⚠️ WARNING - Task 'fe-005' blockedBy references non-existent task 'fe-004'

## Technical Feasibility
✅ PASS - Architecture is sound
✅ PASS - Technology choices are compatible (React 18, Hono v3, Bun)

## Issues Found
**WARNING:** Feature 'reset-password' is missing API error handling in frontend scenarios
**WARNING:** Backend test cases for 'reset-password' don't test password complexity validation
**WARNING:** Task 'fe-005' blockedBy references non-existent task 'fe-004'

## Recommendations
1. Add frontend testing scenario for password reset API errors
2. Add backend test case for password complexity validation in reset flow
3. Fix task dependency: create fe-004 or update fe-005 blockedBy
4. Consider adding rate limiting scenarios for password reset endpoint
